    description: "The Pure Aero Rafa 2023 introduces a brand new specification to one of the most popular racquet families in modern-day tennis. Coming a touch lighter in weight, and with less headlight than the standard Pure Aero, the 2023 version plays more like the Pure Aero Team.  It will pack a tiny bit more punch due to the balance point being closer to the middle.  Although a touch more powerful, expect great results by adding heavy topspin to your groundstrokes. As with most Babolat racquets, the Pure Aero Rafa 2023 continues the legacy of the Aeromodular Beam and the Woofer Grommet system, as well as the more contemporary FSI Spin Technology.  FSI implements wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball.  It's like ordering spin with a side of spin. The reason behind this racquet's success is that it can be used by any age and gender, both intermediates and advanced players. Not only is this a lovely racquet to wield on the court, but also a collector's item for the true racquet enthusiast",
