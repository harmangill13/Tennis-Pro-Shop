Technologies used:
  Javascript, css, html, express, mongoose, mongoDB.

App Approach:
  To make a website where people can find all their tennis needs in one place. Whether you need a new racquet, shoes, tennis balls, new apparel, or you're looking for tennis lessons, or used equipment, we have it all. I wanted to make the app specific to one sport with potentional to grow into a larger platform for different sports. 

User Story:
  When the user is on the webpage, they can shop around for whatever they're looking for and get if that item suits their needs based on its price and description. They can also look on our listings page for services (coaching services) or used equipment to make it more affordable to get into a sport and get the skills you need to have fun right from the beginning!

Notes/unfinished ideas:
  carousel
  add to cart
  switching to a model that actually allows purchases
  create a login feat 
  store user purchases on account to make it easier to find what products they have
